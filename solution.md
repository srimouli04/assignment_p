# Data Ingestion Solution

To design a scalable data ingestion system, I propose utilizing **Apache Kafka** as the messaging broker to collect and process ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data. Kafka's distributed architecture and scalability enable it to handle high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Data Sources**: Ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data are generated from various sources and written to Kafka topics.
2. **Kafka Producers**: Data producers (e.g., JSON, CSV, Avro) send data to Kafka topics using Kafka's producer API.
3. **Kafka Brokers**: Kafka brokers receive and store data in Kafka topics.
4. **Kafka Consumers**: Data consumers (e.g., data processing pipelines) read data from Kafka topics using Kafka's consumer API.

**Data Processing Solution**

To develop data transformation processes, I recommend utilizing **Apache Beam** (Python) to standardize and enrich the data. Beam provides a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Beam pipelines read data from Kafka topics and apply data transformation logic (e.g., data validation, filtering, deduplication).
2. **Data Transformation**: Beam's `Map` and `Filter` transformations are used to process data, ensuring data consistency and quality.
3. **Data Correlation**: Beam's `Combine` transformation is used to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions to provide meaningful insights.

**Data Storage and Query Performance Solution**

To store processed data efficiently and enable fast querying for campaign performance analysis, I propose using **Apache HBase** as the data storage solution. HBase provides a scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database.

### Architecture Overview

1. **HBase Table**: Processed data is written to HBase tables, which are designed for high-performance querying and aggregations.
2. **HBase RegionServer**: HBase RegionServers store and manage HBase tables.
3. **HBase Client**: Data processing pipelines write data to HBase tables using the HBase client API.

**Error Handling and Monitoring Solution**

To create an error handling and monitoring system, I recommend utilizing **Apache Airflow** as the workflow management system. Airflow provides a centralized platform for managing and monitoring data processing workflows.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Airflow DAG**: Airflow DAGs define data processing workflows, including data ingestion, processing, and storage.
2. **Airflow Sensors**: Airflow sensors monitor data processing workflows and detect errors, anomalies, or delays.
3. **Airflow Alerts**: Airflow alerts notify data engineers of errors, anomalies, or delays, enabling prompt resolution to maintain ad campaign effectiveness.

     - Kafka Consumers: Applications consuming data from Kafka topics for further processing.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Producers publish data to Kafka topics.
     - Kafka brokers store data and replicate it across the cluster.
     - Consumers read data from Kafka topics and initiate data processing pipelines.

2. **Data Processing:**
   
   - **Components**:
     - Apache Beam: Unified data processing framework for implementing batch and streaming pipelines.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Beam pipelines read data from Kafka topics.
     - Data transformation logic is applied using Beam's transformations (e.g., data validation, filtering, enrichment).
     - Correlation of ad impressions with clicks and conversions is performed using Beam's capabilities.

   - **Components**:
     - Apache HBase: Distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database for storing processed data efficiently.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Processed data is written to HBase tables designed for high-performance querying and aggregations.
     - Data partitioning is implemented to optimize query performance.
     - Data retention policies are enforced to manage storage costs and compliance requirements.

4. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**

     - Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana): For monitoring system metrics and visualizing performance.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Airflow DAGs define data processing workflows, including ingestion, processing, and storage.
     - Sensors within Airflow monitor workflow execution and detect errors or anomalies.
     - Alerts are triggered to notify data engineers of issues, enabling prompt resolution.

5. **Security:**

   - **Components**:
     - Encryption Mechanisms: Encrypting data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality.
     - Authentication and Authorization: Implementing mechanisms to control access to data and resources.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Encryption mechanisms are applied to protect sensitive data.
     - Authentication and authorization mechanisms are enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

6. **Documentation and Collaboration:**
   
   - **Components**:
     - Comprehensive Documentation: Including architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, configuration settings, and deployment instructions.
   
   - **Workflow**:
     - Documentation facilitates collaboration, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer within the team.
     - Regular updates and reviews ensure documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.

**Improvements and Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Serialization**: Convert CSV data into JSON format before ingestion into Kafka to maintain consistency.
- **Schema Management**: Employ a schema management system to enforce schema compatibility and evolution.
- **Real-time Processing**: Incorporate real-time processing capabilities using Apache Flink or Apache Storm.
- **Data Partitioning**: Partition data in Kafka and HBase to optimize query performance.
- **Data Retention Policies**: Define data retention policies for managing storage costs and compliance requirements.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Failure Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms, checkpointing, and automatic recovery procedures to handle failures gracefully.
- **Documentation and Collaboration**: Document the solution comprehensively to facilitate collaboration, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer.

By integrating these improvements and additional considerations into the final proposed solution, we ensure scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability of the data engineering solution for AdvertiseX.
