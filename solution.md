**Data Ingestion Solution**

I recommend utilizing **Apache Kafka** as the central messaging system for ingesting ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV, converted to JSON), and bid requests (Avro) data. Kafka's distributed architecture and scalability make it well-suited for handling high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.

**Data Processing Solution**

For data transformation processes, I propose using **Apache Beam** (Python). Beam provides a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, allowing for efficient data validation, filtering, enrichment, deduplication, and correlation of ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

**Data Storage and Query Performance Solution**

To store processed data efficiently and enable fast querying for campaign performance analysis, I suggest using **Apache HBase**, a scalable and fault-tolerant NoSQL database. HBase's column-oriented data model and ability to handle high write and read throughput make it suitable for optimizing analytical queries and aggregations.

**Error Handling and Monitoring Solution**

For error handling and monitoring, I recommend utilizing **Apache Airflow** as the workflow management system. Airflow provides a centralized platform for orchestrating data processing workflows, monitoring execution, and triggering alerts to notify data engineers of errors, anomalies, or delays, enabling prompt resolution to maintain ad campaign effectiveness.

**High-Level Design (HLD)**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - **Components:** Apache Kafka, Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers
   - **Workflow:** Producers publish data to Kafka topics, Kafka brokers store and replicate data, Consumers read data from Kafka topics and initiate data processing pipelines.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - **Components:** Apache Beam
   - **Workflow:** Beam pipelines read data from Kafka topics, implement data quality checks and validation, apply data transformation logic, and correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

3. **Data Storage and Query Performance:**
   - **Components:** Apache HBase
   - **Workflow:** Processed data is written to HBase tables designed for high-performance querying and aggregations, data partitioning and indexing strategies are implemented, data retention policies are enforced.

4. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   - **Components:** Apache Airflow, Prometheus, Grafana, Centralized Logging Solution (e.g., ELK Stack)
   - **Workflow:** Airflow DAGs define data processing workflows, sensors monitor execution and detect errors/anomalies, alerts are triggered, monitoring and logging capabilities are enhanced.

5. **Security:**
   - **Components:** Encryption Mechanisms, Authentication and Authorization
   - **Workflow:** Data encryption at rest and in transit is implemented, access control mechanisms are enforced.

6. **Schema Management:**
   - **Components:** Schema Management System (e.g., Apache Avro, Apache Parquet)
   - **Workflow:** Schema compatibility is enforced, and schema evolution is handled gracefully.

**Low-Level Design (LLD)**

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - **Kafka Producers:** Implement producers for each data source (JSON, CSV, Avro) using Kafka's producer API.
   - **Kafka Topics:** Create separate topics for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.
   - **Kafka Consumers:** Implement consumers to read data from Kafka topics and pass it to data processing pipelines.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - **Data Quality and Validation:** Define data quality rules and validation checks (e.g., null/missing values, data format, range checks) within Beam pipelines.
   - **Data Transformation:** Implement Beam transformations (e.g., `Map`, `Filter`, `Combine`) for data filtering, enrichment, deduplication, and correlation.
   - **Data Correlation:** Use Beam's `Combine` transformation to join ad impressions with clicks and conversions based on common keys (e.g., user ID, ad campaign ID).

3. **Data Storage and Query Performance:**
   - **HBase Table Design:** Define HBase table schemas and column families optimized for querying and aggregations.
   - **Data Partitioning:** Partition data in HBase based on appropriate keys (e.g., campaign ID, timestamp) to improve query performance.
   - **Indexing:** Implement indexing strategies in HBase for frequently queried columns or column families.
   - **Data Retention:** Define data retention policies and implement mechanisms for data expiration or archiving.

4. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   - **Airflow DAGs:** Define Airflow DAGs representing the data processing workflows, including tasks for data ingestion, processing, and storage.
   - **Airflow Sensors:** Implement Airflow sensors to monitor data quality, data availability, and pipeline execution.
   - **Alerting:** Configure Airflow to trigger alerts (e.g., email, Slack) for specific error conditions or anomalies.
   - **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrate Prometheus for metric collection, Grafana for visualization, and a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack) for log aggregation and analysis.

5. **Security:**
   - **Data Encryption:** Implement encryption mechanisms (e.g., TLS, Kafka encryption, HBase encryption) for data at rest and in transit.
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Configure authentication (e.g., Kerberos, SASL) and authorization mechanisms (e.g., ACLs, RBAC) for data access control.

6. **Schema Management:**
   - **Schema Registry:** Set up a schema registry (e.g., Apache Avro, Apache Parquet) to store and manage data schemas.
   - **Schema Evolution:** Define processes for schema evolution, compatibility checks, and schema validation.

This HLD and LLD cover the key components, workflows, and low-level implementation details for each aspect of the data engineering solution, including data ingestion, processing, storage, error handling, monitoring, security, and schema management.
