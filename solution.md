# Data Ingestion Solution

To design a scalable data ingestion system, I propose utilizing **Apache Kafka** as the messaging broker to collect and process ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data. Kafka's distributed architecture and scalability enable it to handle high data volumes generated in real-time and batch modes.

**Data Ingestion:**

- **Components**:
  - Apache Kafka: A distributed messaging system for collecting and processing ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data.
  - Kafka Producers: Applications responsible for publishing data to Kafka topics.
  - Kafka Consumers: Applications consuming data from Kafka topics for further processing.

- **Workflow**:
  - Producers publish data to Kafka topics.
  - Kafka brokers store data and replicate it across the cluster.
  - Consumers read data from Kafka topics and initiate data processing pipelines.

**Data Processing Solution**

To develop data transformation processes, I recommend utilizing **Apache Beam** (Python) to standardize and enrich the data. Beam provides a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing.

**Data Storage and Query Performance Solution**

To store processed data efficiently and enable fast querying for campaign performance analysis, I propose using **Apache HBase** as the data storage solution. HBase provides a scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database.

**Error Handling and Monitoring Solution**

To create an error handling and monitoring system, I recommend utilizing **Apache Airflow** as the workflow management system. Airflow provides a centralized platform for managing and monitoring data processing workflows.

**High-Level Design (HLD)**

1. **Data Processing:**
   - **Components**:
     - Apache Beam: Unified data processing framework for implementing batch and streaming pipelines.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Beam pipelines read data from Kafka topics.
     - Data transformation logic is applied using Beam's transformations (e.g., data validation, filtering, enrichment).
     - Correlation of ad impressions with clicks and conversions is performed using Beam's capabilities.

2. **Data Storage and Query Performance:**
   - **Components**:
     - Apache HBase: Distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database for storing processed data efficiently.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Processed data is written to HBase tables designed for high-performance querying and aggregations.
     - Data partitioning is implemented to optimize query performance.
     - Data retention policies are enforced to manage storage costs and compliance requirements.

3. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   - **Components**:
     - Apache Airflow: Workflow management platform for orchestrating data processing workflows and error handling.
     - Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana): For monitoring system metrics and visualizing performance.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Airflow DAGs define data processing workflows, including ingestion, processing, and storage.
     - Sensors within Airflow monitor workflow execution and detect errors or anomalies.
     - Alerts are triggered to notify data engineers of issues, enabling prompt resolution.

4. **Security:**
   - **Components**:
     - Encryption Mechanisms: Encrypting data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality.
     - Authentication and Authorization: Implementing mechanisms to control access to data and resources.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Encryption mechanisms are applied to protect sensitive data.
     - Authentication and authorization mechanisms are enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Documentation and Collaboration:**
   - **Components**:
     - Comprehensive Documentation: Including architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, configuration settings, and deployment instructions.
   - **Workflow**:
     - Documentation facilitates collaboration, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer within the team.
     - Regular updates and reviews ensure documentation remains up-to-date and accurate.

**Improvements and Additional Considerations:**

- **Data Serialization**: Convert CSV data into JSON format before ingestion into Kafka to maintain consistency.
- **Schema Management**: Employ a schema management system to enforce schema compatibility and evolution.
- **Real-time Processing**: Incorporate real-time processing capabilities using Apache Flink or Apache Storm.
- **Data Partitioning**: Partition data in Kafka and HBase to optimize query performance.
- **Data Retention Policies**: Define data retention policies for managing storage costs and compliance requirements.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Failure Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms, checkpointing, and automatic recovery procedures to handle failures gracefully.
- **Documentation and Collaboration**: Document the solution comprehensively to facilitate collaboration, troubleshooting, and knowledge transfer.

By integrating these improvements and additional considerations into the final proposed solution, we ensure scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability of the data engineering solution for AdvertiseX.
